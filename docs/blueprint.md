# **App Name**: Veritas

## Core Features:

- Anonymous Identity Generation: Generates a decentralized identity (DID) using Ethereum/Polygon wallets, allowing users to sign reports cryptographically without revealing personal information.
- Decentralized Report Storage: Encrypts and stores reports on IPFS/Arweave, ensuring data is distributed across multiple nodes and resistant to censorship or deletion.
- Blockchain-Based Proof System: Records the IPFS hash, timestamp, category, and status of each report on a blockchain (Ethereum/Polygon/Solana) to create a tamper-proof, publicly auditable, and censorship-resistant record.
- Community Verification: Implements a DAO-based verification system where verified journalists, lawyers, and activists stake tokens to review reports, ensuring truth without a central authority.
- Fake Report Prevention: Employs mechanisms like staking to submit reports, rate limits per wallet, and reputation scores to discourage spam and maintain the platform's integrity.
- End-to-End Encrypted Editor: Offers users an end-to-end encrypted editor within the frontend (HTML/Tailwind/JS) to compose and submit reports securely.
- AI-Powered Content Moderation Tool: Uses generative AI tool to cross-reference potential duplicate reports to prevent bad actors from exploiting the anonymity of the service.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark indigo (#4B0082) to convey a sense of trust and authority. The dark hue promotes serious, confidential use.
