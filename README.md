🔐 ABHAY – An Anonymous Complaint &amp; Justice Support Platform (An Anonymous Reporter)

📘 Project Description (Full)

ABHAY is a privacy-first anonymous complaint portal designed to empower individuals to report misconduct, harassment, corruption, or injustice without fear of identity exposure. Many people hesitate to raise genuine complaints because revealing their identity can lead to social, academic, or professional retaliation. ABHAY addresses this critical issue by ensuring that no personal identity information is collected, stored, or displayed at any stage of the complaint process.

The system operates without user registration or login and relies on secure session-based anonymity. Each complaint is encrypted before storage and processed through a multi-layer credibility assessment system that analyzes content quality, patterns, and cross-complaint correlations to assist authorities in prioritizing genuine cases. Importantly, ABHAY does not attempt to automatically judge complaints as true or false; instead, it provides decision-support tools that help authorized reviewers evaluate reports responsibly.

To prevent misuse while preserving anonymity, the platform incorporates rate-limiting, abuse detection, and transparent ethical safeguards. All administrative actions are strictly access-controlled and logged. ABHAY is designed as a supportive bridge between truth-seekers and justice systems, offering a safe channel for fearless expression while maintaining legal and ethical accountability.
