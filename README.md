# ABHAY – Anonymous Complaint & Justice Support Platform

**ABHAY** is a privacy-first anonymous complaint portal designed to empower individuals to report misconduct, harassment, corruption, or injustice without fear of identity exposure.

## 🚀 The Mission

Many people hesitate to raise genuine complaints because revealing their identity can lead to social, academic, or professional retaliation. **ABHAY** addresses this critical issue by ensuring that no personal identity information is collected, stored, or displayed at any stage of the complaint process.

## 🛠 Core Architecture

### 1. Absolute Anonymity
- **No Registration/Login**: Operates entirely via session-based anonymity.
- **Identity Cloaking**: Uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to anchor reputation without linking to real-world data.

### 2. Multi-Layer Credibility System (AI-Powered)
- **Decision-Support Tools**: Unlike other platforms, ABHAY does not automatically judge complaints. It provides AI analysis (via Genkit) to help human reviewers evaluate reports responsibly.
- **Pattern Correlation**: Analyzes cross-complaint patterns to identify systemic corruption or recurring harassment issues.
- **Content Quality Analysis**: Distills complex evidence into readable summaries for investigative prioritization.

### 3. Immutable Transparency
- **IPFS Sharding**: Reports are sharded and distributed across decentralized nodes.
- **Blockchain Anchoring**: Content CIDs are anchored to a public ledger, creating an immutable "Proof of Existence" that prevents redaction by authorities.
